# Nuxt Image Component with the Cloudinary Provider

Load Cloudinary images in a Nuxt app with the Nuxt Image component.

## ðŸ§° Using Cloudinary with the Nuxt Image Component

To allow Cloudinary to load with the Image component, simply update your `nuxt.config.ts` file with the following configuration:

```
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@nuxt/image-edge"],
  image: {
    cloudinary: {
      baseURL: `https://res.cloudinary.com/<Your Cloud Name>/image/upload/`,
    },
  },
});
```

Then set the `provider` prop on the Image component to `cloudinary`:
```
<nuxt-img
  provider="cloudinary"
  ...
/>
```
