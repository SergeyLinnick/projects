# React Image Collage with Overlay

Create an image collage with React and also regular JavaScript using the image overlay feature.

## ðŸ§° Setting a base image

An overlay requires a base image resized to the size of the collage, as well hiding the base image with a solid color.

```tsx
import { fill } from '@cloudinary/url-gen/actions/resize';
import { colorize } from '@cloudinary/url-gen/actions/effect';

const baseImg = cld.image("some_image")
  .resize(fill().width(1200).height(1200))
  .effect(colorize().color('white'));
```

## Adding Overlays

With the base image in place, an overlay image can be added. Then a transformation can be applied to resize the overlay image, as well as a position set by the image gravity.

```tsx
baseImg.overlay(
  source(image("paintbrushes")
    .transformation(
      new Transformation().resize(
        fill().width(600).height(1200).gravity(autoGravity())
      )
    )
  )
  .position(
    new Position().gravity(compass("east"))
  )
);
```

See the collage in action at [src/App.tsx](src/App.tsx).
