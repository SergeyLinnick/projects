application.

## ðŸ§° Using ProductGallery in a Solid project

1. To use the ProductGallery widget in a Solid.js app, first load its script:

```
<script src="https://product-gallery.cloudinary.com/all.js" type="text/javascript">
</script>
```

This will add a `cloudinary` property to the `window` object which will contain
a `productWidget` method that you can use to initialize the widget.

2. In `App.jsx`, we are getting images containing the tags "solid-product-gallery" and videos containing the tags "solid-product-gallery-vids". 
Make sure to add these tags to your images and videos in the cloudinary console.

<img src="./cloudinary-manage-tags.png"  height="350px" alt="manage tags in cloudinary" />

Alternatively, you can change the tag names in `App.jsx` to match what the images and videos are tagged in your cloudinary console. Maybe have a dropdown to show the list of tags and show the dynamic gallery based on selection.
