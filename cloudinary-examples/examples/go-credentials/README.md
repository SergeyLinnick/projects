## Install and Configure Cloudinary's Go SDK

* Cloning this repository will include installing the required dependencies, such as the Cloudinary library and the `godotenv` library for importing credentials from the `.env` file.

* In the `.env` file, replace `<your_api_key>`, `<your_api_secret>` and `<your_cloud_name>` with your Cloudinary credentials, which you can find in the [API Keys](https://console.cloudinary.com/settings/api-keys) page of the Console Settings.
