# Next.js Image Component Using the Cloudinary Loader

You can configure Next.js to use Cloudinary when loading images and transforming them for your application.

## 🧰 Using the Cloudinary Loader with the Next.js Image Component

> ⚠️ Note: This is not the recommended approach. Use the CldImage component with [Next Cloudinary](https://next.cloudinary.dev) for first-class support of Cloudinary with the Next.js Image component.

To use Cloudinary as a Loader with the Image component, you must specify a `loader` prop for each instance of an Image.

```js
const normalizeSrc = src => src.replace(/^\//, "");

export default function cloudinaryLoader({ src, width, quality }) {
  const cloudName = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME;
  if (!cloudName) {
    throw new Error(
      "NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME is required in the environment"
    );
  }
  const params = ["f_auto", "c_limit", `w_${width}`, `q_${quality || "auto"}`];
  return `https://res.cloudinary.com/${cloudName}/image/upload/${params.join(",")}/${normalizeSrc(src)}`;
}

<Image ... loader={cloudinaryLoader} />
```

When using the new Next.js App Router, the `loader` prop must be specified in a client component. To solve this, create a wrapper client component like [components/Image.jsx](components/Image.jsx) to use in the App Router

> If you want to specify a loader globally and not use the `loader` prop every time, check out [this example](https://github.com/cloudinary-community/cloudinary-examples/tree/main/examples/nextjs-custom-image-loader)

See the file in action at [pages/index.jsx](pages/index.jsx) & [app/app/page.jsx](app/app/page.jsx).

> Note: If using a custom domain with Cloudinary, be sure use the appropriate the domain instead of `res.cloudinary.com`.

Once configured, you can now specify images relative to where they're stored in your media library.

For instance, if you have an image available at `myimages/image.jpg`, you can use it in your application like:

```jsx
<Image width="..." height="..." src="myimages/image.jpg" alt="..." />
```

To add optimize the quality of the image, add the `quality` prop in the Next.js Image Component.
> Caution: The `quality` prop only accepts number, so qualities like `auto:good`, `auto:best`, etc. are not supported via the Image Component. Use the [`CldImage`](https://github.com/cloudinary-community/cloudinary-examples/tree/main/examples/nextjs-cldimage) component for more advanced features.

```jsx
<Image width="..." height="..." quality={70} src="myimages/image.jpg" alt="..." />
```

As of now, you can configure the `width` and `src` props.
