# Cloudinary Shoppable Video with the Next.js App Router

## ðŸš€ Get Started with This Example

* Install the project dependencies with:

```shell
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

> The project uses pnpm by default, but when worked on individually from the application root, npm should be able to be safely used.

* Add your cloud name as an environment variable inside `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="<Your Cloud Name>"
```

* Start the development server with:

```shell
pnpm run dev
# or
npm run dev
```

* Visit the project at <http://localhost:3000>!

Note: the example images and videos used may not be available on your Cloudinary account. Be sure to update the examples with your own assets!
