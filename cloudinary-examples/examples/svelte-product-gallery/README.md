application.

## ðŸ§° Using ProductGallery in a Svelte project

1. To use the ProductGallery widget in a Svelte app, first load its script:

```
<script src="https://product-gallery.cloudinary.com/all.js" type="text/javascript">
</script>
```

This will add a `cloudinary` property to the `window` object which will contain
a `productWidget` method that you can use to initialize the widget.

2. In `App.svelte`, we are finding images containing the tags "gallery-images" and videos containing the tags "gallery-videos". Make sure to add these tags to your images and videos in the cloudinary console.

Alternatively, you can change the tag names in `App.svelte` to match what the images and videos are tagged in your cloudinary console.
