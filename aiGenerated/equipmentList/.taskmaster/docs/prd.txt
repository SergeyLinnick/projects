# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Equipment List Module

### Overview
Design and implement an Equipment List module for managing portable and field-deployed equipment. The module should support the full lifecycle of equipment, including tracking ownership, maintenance, check-in/out history, usage (meter-based), and status. The focus is on equipment used in the field, assigned to technicians, stored in service vans, or temporarily kept at a facility.

### Technology Stack
- Next.js 15 (React framework)
- React 19 (UI library)
- Shadcn (UI component library)
- Turborepo (monorepo management)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (utility-first CSS)
- Storybook (component documentation)
- TanStack Query 5 (data-fetching/state management)
- React Hook Form (form management)
- Zod (validation)
- Zustand (state management)
- Recharts (charts integration)
- Vitest + React Testing Library (testing)

### Functional Requirements
1. **Equipment Listing View**
    - Table or card-based layout for displaying equipment
    - Columns: Equipment Name & Category, Status, Assigned To, Serial Number, Last Check Out
    - Filters: Category, Status, Assigned To
    - Search bar for quick lookup
    - Actions: Add, Edit, View, Archive equipment
    - Bulk select and actions (Archive, Reassign)
    - Status indicators: Active, In Repair, Out of Service, Retired
    - User avatars or initials for "Assigned To"
    - Responsive design for desktop and mobile

2. **Equipment Categories**
    - Manage categories for equipment (add, edit, delete)
    - Assign equipment to categories

3. **Add/Edit Equipment**
    - Form for adding or editing equipment details
    - Fields: Name, Category, Status, Assigned To, Serial Number, Last Check Out date
    - Validation using React Hook Form + Zod

4. **Equipment Status Management**
    - Track and update equipment status (Active, In Repair, Out of Service, Retired)
    - Visual status indicators in the UI

5. **Assignment & History**
    - Assign equipment to users/technicians
    - Track check-in/check-out history
    - Show last check-out date

6. **Bulk Actions**
    - Select multiple equipment items for bulk actions (Archive, Reassign)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Consistent UI/UX using Shadcn and Tailwind CSS
- Modular, maintainable codebase (monorepo with Turborepo)
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Unit and integration tests for all major features
- Component documentation in Storybook
- Responsive and accessible design

### Out of Scope
- Stationary/factory equipment management
- Advanced analytics (beyond basic status and assignment tracking)

### Example Data (from UI)
- Equipment: Drill 123, Generator X, Pipe Camera, Ladder 10ft, Impact Wrench, Vacuum Pump, Multimeter, Tablet A, Compressor, Torch Kit
- Statuses: Active, In Repair, Out of Service, Retired
- Assigned To: User initials or avatars
- Serial Numbers and Last Check Out dates
