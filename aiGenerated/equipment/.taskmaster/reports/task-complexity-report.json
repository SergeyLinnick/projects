			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex multi-step form with numerous fields, validation rules, and dynamic behavior. It includes file uploads, QR code generation, and dynamic custom fields. The form requires sophisticated state management to handle the multi-step process and autosave functionality. The complexity is high due to the number of fields, validations, and interactions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Equipment Categories Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Equipment Categories Management' task into subtasks: 1) Categories listing view with actions, 2) Category creation and edit form, 3) Category deletion with validation to prevent removing categories in use, and 4) Custom fields configuration per category.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, involving standard CRUD operations for categories with some additional features like custom field associations and validation logic. The UI is relatively straightforward compared to other components in the system, but it does require proper error handling and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Equipment Detail View Screen",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Equipment Detail View Screen' task into subtasks: 1) Header with equipment info and quick actions, 2) Activity timeline component, 3) Current assignment information display, 4) Summary tab implementation, 5) Activity log tab implementation, 6) Ownership/assignment history tab, 7) Additional tabs (inspections, maintenance, service, documents), and 8) Responsive layout implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex, data-rich view with multiple tabs and sections. It requires integrating data from various sources and implementing lazy loading for performance. The component needs to handle different types of data visualization and user interactions across multiple tabs. The comprehensive nature of this view and the amount of data to be displayed makes this highly complex."
