# Overview  
The Equipment Management module provides full lifecycle management for portable and field-deployed equipment. It enables organizations to track ownership, maintenance, check-in/out history, usage (meter-based), and status of equipment that is frequently used in the field, assigned to technicians, stored in service vans, or temporarily kept at a facility. The system is designed to optimize asset utilization, reduce loss, and streamline maintenance and assignment workflows.

# Core Features  
- Equipment Listing View: Table/card-based layout with filters (Category, Status, Assigned To), search bar, bulk select, and actions (Add, Edit, View, Archive, Reassign).
- Add/Edit Equipment Form: Capture equipment details (name, category, make, model, serial number, description, tags, photos, QR code, procurement/warranty info, usage tracking, custom fields).
- Equipment Categories: Manage predefined and custom categories, similar to vehicle groups.
- Equipment View Screen: Detailed summary with timeline (activity log), assignment info, quick actions (Check In, Update Meter), and tabs for summary, activity, ownership/assignment, check-in/out, inspections, maintenance, service history, and documents.
- Assignment & Check-In/Out: Assign equipment to user, vehicle, or facility (one at a time), track permanent/temporary assignments, and maintain assignment/check-in/out history.
- Status Tracking: Support for Active, In Repair, Out of Service, Retired statuses with color indicators.
- Meter & Usage Tracking: Track usage by distance, time, or count with unit validation and history.
- Document Management: Attach photos, manuals, warranty docs, and receipts.
- Bulk Management: Multi-select for bulk actions (archive, reassign).

# User Experience  
- User Personas: Field technicians, fleet managers, warehouse staff, maintenance coordinators.
- Key User Flows: 
  - View/filter/search equipment list
  - Add new equipment
  - Edit equipment details
  - Assign equipment
  - Check in/out equipment
  - Update meter/usage
  - View equipment history and documents
- UI/UX Considerations: 
  - Consistent with Vehicle Management module
  - Clear iconography and color indicators for status/assignment
  - Optimized for bulk actions and quick access to key functions
  - Responsive design for desktop and tablet use

# Technical Architecture  
- System Components: 
  - Frontend (React/Next.js UI)
  - Backend API (CRUD for equipment, assignments, check-in/out, maintenance, documents)
  - Database (equipment, categories, assignments, check-in/out logs, meter readings, documents)
- Data Models: 
  - Equipment (id, name, category, make, model, serial, status, tags, photos, QR, procurement, warranty, usage, custom fields)
  - Assignment (equipment_id, assigned_to_type, assigned_to_id, type, start_date, end_date, history)
  - CheckInOut (equipment_id, user_id/vehicle_id/facility_id, timestamp, notes)
  - Meter (equipment_id, type, value, unit, history)
  - Document (equipment_id, type, file, uploaded_by, date)
- APIs: RESTful endpoints for all CRUD and workflow actions
- Integrations: QR code generation, file storage for documents/photos
- Infrastructure: Cloud or on-prem deployment, secure file storage, scalable DB

# Development Roadmap  
- MVP Requirements:
  - Equipment listing, add/edit form, categories management
  - Assignment and check-in/out workflows
  - Status and meter tracking
  - Document upload/management
  - Bulk actions and search/filter
- Future Enhancements:
  - Advanced reporting/analytics
  - Mobile app support
  - Integration with external asset management or ERP systems
  - Automated maintenance scheduling
  - Custom workflow automation

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Foundation: Equipment data model, categories, and CRUD APIs
- Next: Listing view, add/edit form, and categories management UI
- Then: Assignment and check-in/out logic and UI
- Then: Meter tracking and validation
- Then: Document management
- Then: Bulk actions and advanced filters
- Final: Activity timeline, advanced reporting, and integrations

# Risks and Mitigations  
- Technical: Ensuring unique serial numbers, meter value validation (no backward entries), scalable document storage
- MVP Scope: Focus on core workflows (listing, assignment, check-in/out, meter, docs)
- Resource: Prioritize features for MVP, defer advanced analytics/integrations

# Appendix  
- Status values: Active, In Repair, Out of Service, Retired
- Meter units: Miles, Kilometers, Hours, Minutes, Cycles, Starts, Jobs
- Assignment: Only one entity at a time (user, vehicle, or facility)
- Design: Match Vehicle Management module for consistency
- Color indicators: Red = Out of Service, etc.
- Optimize for bulk management scenarios
