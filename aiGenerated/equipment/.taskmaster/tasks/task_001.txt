# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React/Next.js frontend and backend API structure for the Equipment Management module.
# Details:
Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript support. Set up the folder structure following best practices with separate directories for components, pages, API routes, hooks, utils, and types. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Set up the backend API structure with appropriate middleware for authentication, error handling, and logging. Initialize database connection and ORM setup (e.g., Prisma or Sequelize). Create environment configuration for development, testing, and production environments.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully. Ensure all development tools (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.) are functioning. Test API connectivity and database connection. Create basic smoke tests for the application startup.
