# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Bulk Actions and Advanced Filters
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop functionality for bulk operations on multiple equipment items and advanced filtering options.
# Details:
Create the following features:
1. Bulk actions:
   - Multi-select interface in listing view
   - Bulk archive/unarchive
   - Bulk status change
   - Bulk reassignment
   - Bulk export to CSV/Excel
2. Advanced filters:
   - Filter builder interface
   - Save and load filter presets
   - Filters for all major fields (status, category, assignment, procurement date, warranty status)
   - Custom field filters
3. API endpoints:
   - POST /api/equipment/bulk-actions
   - GET /api/equipment/filter-presets
   - POST /api/equipment/filter-presets

Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive bulk actions. Add progress indicators for long-running bulk operations. Ensure filter combinations work correctly and efficiently.

# Test Strategy:
Test bulk operations with varying numbers of selected items. Verify filter combinations produce correct results. Test saved filter presets. Ensure bulk operations handle errors gracefully, especially partial failures. Test performance with large datasets.
