# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the interface and functionality for managing equipment categories.
# Details:
Implement a categories management interface with:
1. List view of existing categories with edit/delete actions
2. Add/edit form for categories with name and description
3. Validation to prevent deletion of categories in use
4. Ability to set default custom fields for a category
5. Option to set icon or color for visual identification

Create the necessary API endpoints for category CRUD operations if not already implemented. Ensure proper validation and error handling. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.

# Test Strategy:
Test category creation, editing, and deletion. Verify validation prevents deletion of categories in use. Test custom field association with categories. Ensure UI updates immediately after changes.
