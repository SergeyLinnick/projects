Implement data aggregation for reports. Create visualizations using a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts). Add export functionality for reports (PDF, CSV).

# Test Strategy:
Test timeline filtering and display. Verify report data accuracy. Test export functionality for different formats. Ensure visualizations render correctly. Test with large datasets to verify performance.
