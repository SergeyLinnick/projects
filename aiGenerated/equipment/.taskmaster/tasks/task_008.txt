# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Assignment and Check-In/Out Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the logic and UI for assigning equipment and tracking check-in/out activities.
# Details:
Create the following components and functionality:
1. Assignment form with:
   - Selection of assignment type (user, vehicle, facility)
   - Entity selector based on type
   - Assignment duration (permanent/temporary with dates)
   - Notes field
2. Check-in/out workflow with:
   - Action selection (check in/out)
   - Location selection
   - Condition assessment
   - Notes and photo capture
3. Assignment history view with timeline
4. API endpoints for:
   - POST /api/equipment/:id/assign
   - POST /api/equipment/:id/check-in
   - POST /api/equipment/:id/check-out
   - GET /api/equipment/:id/assignment-history

Implement validation to ensure equipment can only be assigned to one entity at a time. Add confirmation steps for reassignment of already assigned equipment.

# Test Strategy:
Test assignment to different entity types. Verify check-in/out process works correctly. Test validation rules for assignments. Ensure history is properly recorded and displayed. Test edge cases like reassigning already assigned equipment.
