# Description: Create the detailed equipment view screen with timeline, assignment info, and tabbed sections.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive detail view with:
1. Header with equipment name, status, and quick action buttons
2. Activity timeline showing all events related to the equipment
3. Current assignment information with quick reassign option
4. Tabbed interface with sections for:
   - Summary (basic details)
   - Activity log (detailed history)
   - Ownership/assignment history
   - Check-in/out history
   - Inspections
   - Maintenance records
   - Service history
   - Documents
5. Quick actions for Check In/Out, Update Meter, Edit, Archive

Implement data fetching for each tab with lazy loading for performance. Create reusable components for timeline entries, assignment cards, etc. Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation between tabs. Verify all data is displayed correctly. Test quick actions functionality. Ensure lazy loading works properly for performance. Test responsive behavior at different viewport sizes.
