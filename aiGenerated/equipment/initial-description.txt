Imlement quipment design according main requirements


Implement the UI/UX for the Equipment module. This module will support full lifecycle management of portable and field-deployed equipment, with tracking for ownership, maintenance, check-in/out history, usage (meter-based), and status.

Unlike stationary factory equipment, this module focuses on equipment that is frequently used in the field or assigned to technicians, stored in service vans, or temporarily kept at a facility.
